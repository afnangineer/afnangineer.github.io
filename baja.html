                            SAE Baja is a national competitive event that challenges collegiate teams to design and
                            build
                            their own roll cage vehicles to withstand the rough terrain of the course. The competition
                            would make the AWD configuration a requirement of all teams in 2021, and early integration
                            of it
                            would award 2020 teams with additional points per event category. The 2020 drivetrain
                            team decided to design a 4WD system with forward capabilities, allowing future teams more
                            time to focus
                            on testing than reinventing the wheel. </br>

                    <h3>DESIGN JUSTIFICATION OF CUSTOM COMPONENTS</h3>
                    <h4>Jackshaft, Chain Drive, and Transfer Case Primary Mounting Plate</h4>
                    Coupling the CVT directly to the transfer case (TC) would have required modifying its splined
                    input shaft--likely hardened--and offsetting the engine 4" to the left. The CVT secondary and cover
                    would extend below the floor of the chassis, requiring extra
                    members to protect them, and the interface between them would have been difficult to manufacture.

                                        alt="jackshaft assembly">To circumvent this, a
                                    jackshaft and chain drive asssembly would transmit power from the CVT secondary
                                    output to the TC input. This introduced a different loading scenario, which was now
                                    receiving input from the chain drive rather than the driveshaft.
                                </span></div>

                                        alt="tc primary mounting plate">Bearing failure on the TC was the first point of
                                    concern, as
                                    it recessed
                                    ~3” from the sprocket. This led the decision to redesign the plate housing the oil
                                    seal to
                                    include a second bearing, reducing the overhung load to ~1 and increasing bearing
                                    life.

                                    challenge with mounting the TC. The
                                    existing mounting points lie on a plane that is not parallel to the axis of the
                                    input shaft, resulting in a downward pitch (marker for reference). </span></div>

                    The 22 tooth spline profile of the transfer case is male, and the rear differential is female.
                    With Polaris' proprietary spline profiles, reverse engineering the splines would have been necessary
                    to
                    create a custom coupler. The cost-effective and timely solution was to modify an existing Rhino
                    chromoly slip yoke with the 22 male to female coupling capability. The sleeves were turned down to
                    create a coupler of a consistent diameter, and we were able to interface the rear differential and
                    transfer case.

                                    spring preload and belt tension. Testing was performed by
                                    collecting RPM of the primary and secondary pulley of the CVT. RPM data was gathered
                                    using
                                    hall

                                    output).
                                    Changing the springs and fly weights would identify any suboptimal

        <!-- The duality of my roles meant that I gained the technical understanding needed to build the
                            vehicle and the design implications of bringing the project in on time and on budget. I
                            gained technical understanding of rotating machinery design, power transmission, parametric
                            modeling to evaluate performance trade-offs, and geartrain component design. I was able
                            to cross-communicate effectively during design integration phases and exercise creative
                            problem-solving when design interferences arose between subsystems. My sincerity
                            produced a sense of enthusiasm that resulted in quality work, and the vehicle received the
                            highest national placement in all categories that any CU Boulder Baja car has ever received.
